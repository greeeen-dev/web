                If you're from Zen Browser's Discord (or the community-made custom themes server), you may know me as
                the creator of Natsumi Browser. Well, welcome to my personal website/portfolio, where I showcase my
                stuff, and do whatever I want on here I guess.<br>
                <br>
                And since this is my personal site, I thought it'd be a good idea to make a statement on what Natsumi
                really is, and what I want everyone to know.<br>
                <br>
                Natsumi is my personal Zen Browser skin. I made it because I wanted to make the browser something
                personal to me. I loved how Zen looked, but I wanted to take it a step further and just make it my own.
                So I created Natsumi, where all of the design choices were made by me, and not by others.<br>
                <br>
                But ever since I made it public following popular demand, I've had to deal with a lot of attacks and
                harassment. I made it clear on the README file from day one that it's my personal skin I made public due
                to popular demand, but there's still some people that just don't get it. Why do they not get it? I don't
                know, maybe they didn't bother to read the README or just expect things beyond what I want to do for the
                project.<br>
                <br>
                Being brutally honest, I regret making Natsumi public. Although I now hold the position of being the
                creator of what many call "the most influential custom CSS in the Zen Browser community", it's honestly
                more of a burden than an accomplishment. When I have to deal with users that keep telling me to change
                the design of Natsumi when I like the design and don't want to change it, only to be met with backlash
                and harassment for refusing to change it, it's exhausting. One can say I'm being selfish and rude, but
                I don't think I deserve to be labeled as such when people just refuse to understand why I made Natsumi
                and why I designed it that way.<br>
                <br>
                I'm already burnt out, please behave yourselves before I take this private once and for all. I give zero
                fucks about fame, I'd rather lose all of my users overnight than let selfish people harass me into
                deviating from the project's core values of keeping things personal.<br>
                <br>
                To those that understand what I'm trying to do with Natsumi and don't attack me for it, thank you.
