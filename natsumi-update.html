                In case you missed it, I decided to archive Natsumi a few days ago.<br>
                <br>
                Before I go on, I want to clarify that this wasn't done for attention. This wasn't a test to see how the
                community would react if I suddenly said that I'd give up. My decision was very much a real one, I
                genuinely wanted to call it quits for good.<br>
                <br>
                But the respect people showed for the project after I made the decision was just really heartwarming. A
                lot of people were respectful of my choice, and they thanked me for the hard work I've done for the
                project. This made me come to realize that I've been focusing way too much on being hurt over the "vocal
                minority" that kept complaining about the design, and not enough on the people that actually appreciated
                the project and the work I've done for it.<br>
                <br>
                And thanks to the support I've been getting from both the community and my girlfriend, I was able to
                find my love and passion for the project all over again, and I've decided to bring it back again, but
                with some conditions:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All questions and bug reports (unless critical) must be on GitHub, no support will be provided
                        on Discord
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Very small questions such as "how do I enable a feature" are exempt from this, they may
                                be asked outside GitHub
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Any questions on changing the design will be met with a "just got ChatGPT it" response (credits
                        to the creator of
                        <a href="https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Nebula-A-Minimal-Theme-for-Zen-Browser">Nebula</a> for
                        the idea)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ignore/block those who modify Natsumi then ask me why it's broken, even on GitHub (please don't
                        do this)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Work on it less frequently to prevent burnout
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                From now on, I'll usually follow a rotation schedule where for every three weeks I spend
                                on <a href="https://unifierhq.org">Unifier</a>, I'll spend just one week on Natsumi
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                I feel like these conditions will allow me to work in a more sustainable environment, and I hope that
                everyone can understand. I'm really sorry for suddenly archiving Natsumi out of nowhere, and I'll learn
                to appreciate my community more from now on.<br>
                <br>
                And I hope that the "vocal minority" I mentioned can also understand the whole purpose of the project,
                too.
