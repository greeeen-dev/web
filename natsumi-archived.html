                If you're reading this, Natsumi has been archived. Thank you for your support over the past few
                months.<br>
                <br>
                Some of you may think I'm being crazy for giving up on what many call "the most influential Zen Browser
                skin", especially when I just released Natsumi v3. But being brutally honest, fame and influence
                <strong>fucking suck</strong>.<br>
                <br>
                Natsumi was meant to be a personal skin. But as I kept working on it, it felt more like I was working
                for others, when Natsumi wasn't meant to be that at all. I tried to perservere through even the harshest
                criticism against the design, but this just broke me more. It was like I was in a constant battle
                between staying true to my own values and giving in and turning Natsumi into something that isn't what
                I wanted.<br>
                <br>
                And my recent interactions with the Zen Browser's issue volunteers (I said "volunteers" first, but
                apparently that was not the right word for it) did not help AT ALL. What was meant to be a discussion
                about Revolt and how their community reacted to Zen turned from just some banter to straightup going
                after me for the sake of it (and yes, I've blocked the people that did that long before writing this),
                solely because I pointed out how they're criticizing Revolt for being a "Discord clone" when Zen is also
                very similar to Arc. Although most in the discussion remained civil and kept criticism constructive,
                some definitely took it too far, and that was the last straw for discontinuing Natsumi, as the attacks
                just made me feel more distant and hated by the very community that uses the project.<br>
                <br>
                I'll be going all-in on Unifier now. When I have a community that actually cares for me and appreciates
                me for what I do instead of judging every single decision I make along the way and doesn't blindly call
                what I made a clone solely because I "defended" Revolt, the smaller community size compared to that of
                Natsumi Browser's doesn't matter in the end. This is why Unifier almost never burns me out, and why I
                consider it my pride instead of a more popular project like Natsumi.<br>
                <br>
                If you're willing to "continue" Natsumi, <strong>please don't</strong>. I want this project to be
                left alone for good, I want it to "pass away" peacefully instead of being forced to stay alive for
                longer just for the sake of it.<br>
                <br>
                I'm sorry to the Natsumi fans that have supported me since I started the project, but now it's time for
                me to move on. Catering for a community that doesn't care about me at all even in the slightest bit
                isn't what I'm here for.
